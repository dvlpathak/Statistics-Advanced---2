    "Q1. What is hypothesis testing in statistics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "    Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with an assumption (the null hypothesis, H₀).\n",
    "We collect sample data and use a test statistic to see if there is enough evidence to reject H₀ in favor of the alternative hypothesis, H₁.\n",
    "It helps answer questions like, “Is a new drug more effective than the old one?” by comparing sample results to a probability model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the null hypothesis, and how does it differ from the alternative hypothesis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "    Null Hypothesis (H₀)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumes no effect or no difference\n",
    "\n",
    "It's the default or starting assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "We test this hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \"The new drug has no effect\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumes an effect or a difference exists\n",
    "\n",
    "What the researcher wants to prove\n",
    "\n",
    "Accepted if H₀ is rejected\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \"The new drug works better\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Explain the significance level in hypothesis testing and its role in deciding the outcome of a test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "    The significance level is the probability of rejecting H₀ when it is actually true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common values: 0.05 (5%), 0.01 (1%).\n",
    "\n",
    "It sets the threshold for deciding whether observed data is “rare enough” to reject H₀.\n",
    "Example: α = 0.05 means we accept a 5% chance of making a wrong rejection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4 . What are Type I and Type II errors? Give examples of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "    Type I Error (False Positive)\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Rejecting the null hypothesis (H₀) when it is actually true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning: You think there is an effect or difference, but there isn’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "A COVID-19 test says a healthy person has the virus.\n",
    "(You wrongly detect a disease that isn't there.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Type II Error (False Negative)\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning: You think there is no effect, but there actually is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "A COVID-19 test says an infected person is healthy.\n",
    "(You miss a real disease.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is the difference between a Z-test and a T-test? Explain when to use each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "     Z-test\n",
    "\n",
    "Used when the population standard deviation (σ) is known\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample size is usually large (n > 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumes the data follows a normal distribution or large enough for Central Limit Theorem to apply\n",
    "\n",
    "Test statistic follows a standard normal distribution (Z-distribution)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Testing the average height of a large group when σ is known\n",
    "\n",
    "     T-test\n",
    "\n",
    "Used when the population standard deviation (σ) is unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample size is usually small (n < 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses the sample standard deviation (s) instead of σ\n",
    "\n",
    "Test statistic follows a t-distribution, which has thicker tails to account for extra uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Testing the average weight of a small sample where σ is unknown\n",
